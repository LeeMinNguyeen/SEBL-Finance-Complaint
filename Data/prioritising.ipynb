Per 15 USC 1666 ( b ) you can not list a payment late on an open account or closed if there is a billing error or unless you can prove with incontrovertible evidence that it was mailed and delivered before 21 days of the due date. No proof has been given or shown and the XXXX party never requested proof to confirm before marking my credit profile with a late payment. Not only did I not receive these said notices and instructions. I also have not received any proof of the damaging action of a late payment.The things that are being reported are affecting my business reputation in a negative way. It is causing me higher interest rates and credit denials. It is also causing immense amounts of stress. Which is also hurting me on an emotional, physical and mental level. If this is not rectified within 30 days I will be left with no choice but to further my elevated stress by pursuing legal action exercising my rights in 15 USC 1692 ( b ) ( d ) ( e ) ( k ). As their choice to not manually perform an investigation and to rely on XXXX  is also causing further damage.

Per 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) I am supposed to receive knowledge of my rights to opt-out of my personal information being disclosed/reported through a 3rd party unaffiliate and then a second notice to instruct me on that process. Per 15 USC 1666 ( b ) you can not list a payment late on an open account or closed if there is a billing error or unless you can prove with incontrovertible evidence that it was mailed and delivered before 21 days of the due date. No proof has been given or shown and the XXXX party never requested proof to confirm before marking my credit profile with a late payment. Not only did I not receive these said notices and instructions. I also have not received any proof of the damaging action of a late payment.The things that are being reported are affecting my business reputation in a negative way. It is causing me higher interest rates and credit denials. It is also causing immense amounts of stress. Which is also hurting me on an emotional, physical and mental level. If this is not rectified within 30 days I will be left with no choice but to further my elevated stress by pursuing legal action exercising my rights in 15 USC 1692 ( b ) ( d ) ( e ) ( k ). As their choice to not manually perform an investigation and to rely on XXXX  is also causing further damage.
